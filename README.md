## 🖥️ Backend Setup

### 📁 Location
Go to the backend folder:
```bash
cd ./backend
```

### ⚙️ Environment Variables

The backend requires a .env file in the ./backend directory.
Create a file named .env with the following structure (adjust values as needed):
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-ziyo_IyTCDB174vZ...
```

### ▶️ Run the Server

You can start the FastAPI backend using either script:
On Linux / macOS / Git Bash
```bash
./start.sh
```
On Windows (Command Prompt or double-click)
```bash
./start.bat
```
The script will automatically:

    Create a Python virtual environment (if it doesn’t exist)

    Install all dependencies from requirements.txt

    Start the FastAPI development server at
    👉 http://127.0.0.1:8000

## 🌐 Frontend Setup
### 📁 Location
Go to the React frontend folder:
```bash
cd ./frontend/react-app
```
### ⚙️ Environment Variables

The frontend also requires a .env file in the ./frontend/react-app directory.
Create a file named .env with the following content (adjust if your backend URL differs):
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

### 📦 Install Dependencies

Install all required npm packages:
```bahs
npm install
```
### ▶️ Run the Development Server

Start the frontend with:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will start on 👉 http://localhost:5173 (or whichever port Vite selects).

### 🧠 Notes

    The backend runs on FastAPI + SQLModel + Uvicorn

    The frontend runs on React + Vite

### 💡 Tip:
You can have both backend and frontend running simultaneously — open two terminals, one for each.
